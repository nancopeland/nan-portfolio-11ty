	<h1>News quiz</h1>
<p class="date">May 18, 2021</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cschieffer">Chris Schieffer</a> and I decided to update the <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/the-slate-quiz">Slate news quiz</a> because it was one of the last features that hadn't be redesigned to fit <a href="https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/jason-santa-maria-on-how-slate-redesigned-the-way-we-work.html">Slate's new style</a>. The quiz had been built at least 8 years prior so the interface was outdated and the scoring was not secure, according to the dev team.</p>

<p>After meeting with the editorial, product and dev teams, Chris and I decided on this list of features for the MVP and post-MVP:</p>
<h3>MVP</h3>
<p><strong>Features to keep:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quiz basics
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Question</li>
<li>Answer choices (4)</li>
<li>Timer/countdown</li>
<li>Score</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Play against a Slatester</li>
<li>Leaderboard
<ul>
<li>Should be able to toggle between Plus Members and Slatesters (including state where you are not signed in to Plus)</li>
<li>Show your score against the average and Slatester you played against at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Way to review your answers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features to disregard:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Coin counter/coins as the score</li>
</ul>
<h3>Post-MVP</h3>
<ul>
<li>Account registration to take quiz</li>
<li>Update quiz builder</li>
<li>Non-news quiz &gt; how is this built differently from a news quiz?
<ul>
<li>Will there be a timer for non-news quizzes?</li>
<li>Leaderboard should be able to be turned off based on &quot;quiz type&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Show percentage of readers that got each question correct</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the way the old quiz worked was that it was an <code class="language-html">iframe</code> placed in a regular Slate article template. I wanted to convert the quiz to its own Clay components because, in my opinion, <code class="language-html">iframe</code>s more than likely ruin the experience. The dev team overruled me on this because updating the quiz builder would be very difficult but assured me we could improve the <code class="language-html">iframe</code> experience. This was important to know up front bc I needed to design for two different implementations: <strong><a href="https://clay.nymag.com/">Clay</a> template</strong> and <strong>iframe</strong>.</p>
<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>I started by laying out the current user journey of the news quiz to make sure I designed for all the various states.</p>
<p><img src="/img/news_quiz/quiz_user_flow.jpg" alt="quiz user journey">
<span class="caption">User journey</span></p>
<p>The first thing I knew I wanted to change about the old design was the powerpoint &quot;slide&quot; layout. Why hide the questions with a slide when they could build down the page for easier review at the end? I also knew I wanted to orient the questions on top of the answers (instead of side-by-side) because that is a more natural orientation for mobile scrolling.</p>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">

		<span class="caption">Wireframe idea that shows the timer and score in the top right and a preview of the next question greyed out below</span> 
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img src="/img/news_quiz/questions_2.png" alt="Wireframe idea that shows the correct answer, the timer and score in the bottom right and a preview of the next question greyed out below" />
		<span class="caption">Wireframe idea that shows the correct answer, the timer and score in the bottom right and a preview of the next question greyed out below</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p>I thought the transition between questions could be similar to the <a href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a> forms minus the difficult scrolling back up to see previous questions.</p>
<p><img src="/img/news_quiz/typeform_demo.gif" alt="Typeform demo">
<span class="caption">Typeform demo</span></p>
<p>For the &quot;end of quiz&quot; experience, I knew I wanted to orient the score comparison chart horizontally (again, better for mobile). For the leaderboard, you had to be a <a href="https://slate.com/plus">Slate Plus</a> member to be on the leaderboard and to see the &quot;Slatester&quot; scores but anyone could see the Slate Plus member scores. This is a bit confusing so I thought I'd just make it so you have to be a Slate Plus member to see the whole leaderboard.</p>

<h2>User Testing/ edits</h2>
<p>Once I decided on a wireframe and general experience, I thought it would be best to user test it before getting too far along. Initially, I thought the quickest way to test this in person would be to talk to my interal Slate coworkers. I showed them the old quiz experience vs. the new quiz experience and asked them to compare them.</p>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img src="/img/news_quiz/old_quiz_desktop.gif" alt="Old news quiz experience" />
		<span class="caption">Old news quiz experience</span> 
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img src="/img/news_quiz/new_news_quiz_experience.gif" alt="New news quiz experience" />
		<span class="caption">New news quiz experience</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p>Users liked the new experience but missed the Slate-y whimsical design of the old experience. Users also indicated that the timer and score were a bit confusing, probably because of the removal of coins in the new design.</p>
<p>While the experience I showed users in this round of testing was a wireframe, I thought I should meet with Slate's art team to see if they had any suggestions on how to make the experince more whimsical. <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewsRamo">Natalie Matthews-Ramo</a> suggested making the whole news quiz page feel more &quot;special&quot; with a banner at the top and generally adding more color to the page. She also suggested added a circular timer that is only visible when the user is being timed.</p>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-33">
		<img src="/img/news_quiz/NMR_1.png" alt="Beginning of quiz with banner at the top" />
		<span class="caption">Beginning of quiz with banner at the top</span>

		<span class="caption">Question layout with timer counting down</span>

		<img src="/img/news_quiz/NMR_3.png" alt="End of quiz chart comparing scores" />
		<span class="caption">End of quiz chart comparing scores</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p>I knew that adding the top banner would be a template change and not easy to do for user testing but I could incorporate the timer and some of the smaller design elements for the next round of testing.</p>
<p>For the next round of testing, I decided to test Slate readers who are frequent Slate News Quiz takers. Because these users were so familiar with the old news quiz experience, I decided to just show them the new one and told them to refer to the old one if necessary for comparison.</p>
<p><img src="/img/news_quiz/new_news_quiz_experience_v2.gif" alt="new experience with design updates">
<span class="caption">New experience with design updates</span></p>
<p>Users missed the old experience but didn't think the new experience was difficult to understand so I proceeded with building this experience in a new template.</p>
<h2>Final result</h2>
<p>Editorial, product, dev, art and I all decided the new quiz experience in a new template was a great idea. I was easier to use than the old quiz experience but still felt special and differentiated from a regular Slate article. But, I wanted to user test it one more time to make sure users wouldn't have trouble when it was finally launched.</p>

<p>When user testing this, I noticed a few issues with ads that we needed to update for this template and also that the &quot;start quiz&quot; button and the share buttons were similar in size. To fix that, I updated the look of the share buttons to look more like secondary links.</p>

<p>This project has not gone live but when it does, it will be at <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/the-slate-quiz">slate.com/news-and-politics/the-slate-quiz</a>.</p>
<p>I worked on this project with many people: Product management was led by <a href="https://twitter.com/cschieffer">Chris Schieffer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mwieg">Megan Wiegand</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/abbjmc">Abby McIntyre</a> provided lots of valuable editorial and CMS feedback. Development work was led by <a href="https://github.com/macgyver">Jonathan Zuckerman</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ivanfex">Ivan Felix</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewsRamo">Natalie Matthews-Ramo</a> provided me with great visual feedback and edits to make the whole experience feel more Slate-y.</p>
