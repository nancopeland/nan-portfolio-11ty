	<h1>News quiz</h1>
<p class="date">May 18, 2021</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cschieffer">Chris Schieffer</a> and I decided to update the <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/the-slate-quiz">Slate news quiz</a> because it was one of the last features that hadn't be redesigned to fit <a href="https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/jason-santa-maria-on-how-slate-redesigned-the-way-we-work.html">Slate's new style</a>. The quiz had been built at least 8 years prior so the interface was outdated and the scoring was not secure, according to the dev team.</p>

<p>After meeting with the editorial, product and dev teams, Chris and I decided on this list of features for the MVP and post-MVP:</p>
<h3>MVP</h3>
<p><strong>Features to keep:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quiz basics
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Question</li>
<li>Answer choices (4)</li>
<li>Timer/countdown</li>
<li>Score</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Play against a Slatester</li>
<li>Leaderboard
<ul>
<li>Should be able to toggle between Plus Members and Slatesters (including state where you are not signed in to Plus)</li>
<li>Show your score against the average and Slatester you played against at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Way to review your answers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features to disregard:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Coin counter/coins as the score</li>
</ul>
<h3>Post-MVP</h3>
<ul>
<li>Account registration to take quiz</li>
<li>Update quiz builder</li>
<li>Non-news quiz &gt; how is this built differently from a news quiz?
<ul>
<li>Will there be a timer for non-news quizzes?</li>
<li>Leaderboard should be able to be turned off based on &quot;quiz type&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Show percentage of readers that got each question correct</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the way the old quiz worked was that it was an <code class="language-html">iframe</code> placed in a regular Slate article template. I wanted to convert the quiz to its own Clay components because, in my opinion, <code class="language-html">iframe</code>s more than likely ruin the experience. The dev team overruled me on this because updating the quiz builder would be very difficult but assured me we could improve the <code class="language-html">iframe</code> experience.</p>
<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>I started by laying out the current user journey of the news quiz to make sure I designed for all the various states.</p>

<p>The first thing I knew I wanted to change about the old design was the powerpoint &quot;slide&quot; layout. Why hide the questions with a slide when they could build down the page for easier review at the end? I also knew I wanted to orient the questions on top of the answers (instead of side-by-side) because that is a more natural orientation for mobile scrolling.</p>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">

		<img src="/img/news_quiz/questions_1.png" alt="Wireframe idea that shows the timer and score in the top right and a preview of the next question greyed out below" />
		<span class="caption">Wireframe idea that shows the timer and score in the top right and a preview of the next question greyed out below</span> 
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img src="/img/news_quiz/questions_2.png" alt="Wireframe idea that shows the correct answer, the timer and score in the bottom right and a preview of the next question greyed out below" />
		<span class="caption">Wireframe idea that shows the correct answer, the timer and score in the bottom right and a preview of the next question greyed out below</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p>I thought the transition between questions could be similar to the <a href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a> forms minus the difficult scrolling back up to see previous questions.</p>

<p>For the &quot;end of quiz&quot; experience, I knew I wanted to orient the score comparison chart horizontally (again, better for mobile). For the leaderboard, you had to be a <a href="https://slate.com/plus">Slate Plus</a> member to be on the leaderboard and to see the &quot;Slatester&quot; scores but anyone could see the Slate Plus member scores. This is a bit confusing so I thought I'd just make it so you have to be a Slate Plus member to see the whole leaderboard.</p>
