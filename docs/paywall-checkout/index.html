	<h1>User testing: paywall checkout</h1>
<p class="date">November 02, 2020</p>
<h2>Brief history</h2>
<p>Over the past year, I've been working on the Slate paywall (see other post on <a href="/paywall-podcasts">podcasts</a>). One of the parts of the paywall I spent the most time on was testing the checkout process because I knew it was crucial to the paywall being successful.</p>
<p>Before mocking, I checked out a few other sites. All sites started with an &quot;offer&quot; landing page and then I was asked for my account and payment information. Some sites had the account and payment forms on the same page as the &quot;offer&quot; and some sites took you to a different page. I mocked up these two flows for Slate but wasn't sure which one would make for a better user experience so I decided to do a few rounds of user testing.</p>
<h2>User testing</h2>
<h3>1. <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392870677_1_page_-_1">1-page</a> vs. <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392875148_3_page_-_1">3-page</a> experience</h3>
<p>For the first test, I tested a 1-page checkout experience vs. a 3-page checkout experience. I screened for users that read media sites at least once per week.</p>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-50">

		<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392870677_1_page_-_1">1-page checkout</a></span>
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="checkout experience that is broken up into 3 pages" src="/img/checkout/UT1_3page.gif">
		<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392875148_3_page_-_1">3-page checkout</a></span>
	</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Overall, users understood both processes. When I asked which experience users preferred (something I am trying to not do anymore because I don't think an experience should be dictated by preference), they preferred the 1-page experience so I decided to go with that.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/397971678_1-Page_Steps_-_LP">Forgot password experience</a></h3>
<p>For the next test, I wanted to test switching from the account creation form to the log in form. Slate has a lot of active commenters with accounts so I thought this might be a future use-case they'd have to deal with.</p>
<p>One issue I had with this round of testing was that Invision doesn't allow <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp">smooth scrolling</a> transitions, which is what I had envisioned for the 1-page experience, so I couldn't mimic a coded experience as well as I had hoped.</p>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="log in form with forgot password link" src="/img/checkout/UT2_login_form.png">
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="forgot password form" src="/img/checkout/UT2_forgot_password.png">
	</div>
	<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/397971678_1-Page_Steps_-_LP">Forgot password experience</a></span>
</div>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> I asked users to subscribe as if they already had an account but couldn't remember their password. While 2 of the 8 users couldn't find the &quot;forgot password&quot; link, <strong>the users who went through the whole ‚Äúforgot password‚Äù flow thought it was straightforward.</strong></p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/1-page.html">Coded 1-page experience</a></h3>
<p>Because of the limitations with Invision and smooth scrolling, I wanted to test a coded version of the 1-page experience, just to make sure. Again, I asked users to assume they already had an account so they had to switch from the account creation to login form.</p>
<p>For this test, I broke up users into &quot;young&quot; (25-45) and &quot;old&quot; (45-65). According to the data team, &quot;[Slate's] median age range is 35 to 44, and 50% of Slate.com readers are between ages 35 and 54&quot; so I wanted to see if age affected the the outcome of the test.</p>
<p><img src="/img/checkout/UT3_coded_1page.gif" alt="coded 1-page checkout experience">
<span class="caption"><a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/1-page.html">Coded 1-page experience</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> 8 users (of 10 total), specifically older users, had difficulty with this task. Some users didn‚Äôt log in before payment (you could see the payment form grey-ed out) while some users had trouble finding the ‚Äúlog in‚Äù link because both the account and payment forms were on the same page.</p>
<p>Because of this, I wondered if I could <strong>test this same flow and set of users with a coded 3-page experience and see if I got the same results.</strong> Accounts are always difficult so I thought isolating each step might help.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/3-page_plans.html">Coded 3-page experience</a></h3>
<p>For this test, I used the same screening questions and test questions as the previous test but the steps were broken up into 3 pages (like I tested in the initial test).</p>
<p><img src="/img/checkout/UT4_coded_3page.gif" alt="coded 3-page checkout experience">
<span class="caption"><a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/3-page_plans.html">Coded 3-page experience</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> 4 users (of 10 total) had difficulty with this task. From this, I assumed the <strong>3-page experience was easier to understand for users trying to go from the ‚Äúcreate account‚Äù form to the ‚Äúlog in‚Äù form.</strong></p>
<h2>Decision</h2>
<p>Based on the user feedback, I decided to go with the 3-page checkout process with very clear links to ‚Äúlog in‚Äù and ‚Äúcreate account‚Äù to toggle between the two forms. From the initial test, I remembered users understood both flows so when I considered what the data team said about Slate's age range, I thought the 3-page experience was a better fit.</p>
<p>After many more rounds of wireframing and mocking, the checkout process ended up here:</p>
