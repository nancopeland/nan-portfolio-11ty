	<h1>Slate paywall</h1>
<p class="date">July 04, 2020</p>
<h2>Brief history</h2>
<p>After meeting with the product manager, <a href="https://twitter.com/heidimoon">Heidi Strom Moon</a>, I broke out the project into three [large] groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>site prompts</li>
<li>landing page &amp; checkout process</li>
<li>account management</li>
</ol>
<h2>Checkout process</h2>
<p>Before mocking, I checked out a few other sites. All sites started with an &quot;offer&quot; landing page and then I was asked for my account and payment information. Some sites had the account and payment forms on the same page as the landing page and some sites took you to a different page. For initial mocks, I mocked up both of these experiences because I wasn't sure which one was best.</p>
<p>Over the course of designing this flow, I did 6 rounds of user testing to get the checkout process optimized for Slate's readers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392870677_1_page_-_1">1-page</a> vs. <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392875148_3_page_-_1">3-page</a></strong> -
Users understood both 1-page and 3-page experiences but because people preferred the 1-page (and I preferred it), I went with 1-page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account creation <a href="https://www.sketch.com/s/60150400-a0d8-40bc-ab8f-c9d1e1ce7c98/a/2RgAr5/play">before</a> vs. <a href="https://www.sketch.com/s/60150400-a0d8-40bc-ab8f-c9d1e1ce7c98/a/dPQLMm/play">after</a> payment</strong> -
Because users thought having account creation after payment was weird and the dev team was opposed to account creation not being explicitly linked to subscription, I decided to keep account creation first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1-page <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/397971678_1-Page_Steps_-_1">“stepped” layout</a></strong> -
For the 1-page “stepped” experience test, no one had a hard time with this but 2 users (of 8) said they would have <strong>preferred the checkout form was on a different page</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/397971678_1-Page_Steps_-_LP">Forgot password</a> using &quot;stepped&quot; layout</strong> - For the “forgot password” test, I asked users to subscribe as if they already have an account but can’t remember their password. <strong>The users who went through the whole “forgot password”  thought it was straightforward.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/1-page.html">Coded 1-page “stepped” experience</a></strong> -
Users, specifically older users, had varying degrees of difficulty (8 out of 10 users) logging into their account and subscribing. Because of this, I wondered if I could <strong>test this same flow and set of users with a coded 3-page experience and see if I got the same results.</strong> Accounts are always difficult, especially for older users, but i thought simplifying each step might help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/3-page_plans.html">Coded 3-page experience</a></strong> -
4 users (of 10 total) had a bit or a lot of difficulty with this task and only 2 of those users were in the “older” category. From this, I assumed the <strong>3-page experience was easier to understand for users trying to go from the “create account” form to the “log in” form.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Decision</h2>
<p>Based on the user feedback, I decided to go with the 3-page checkout process with very clear links to “log in” and “create account” to toggle between the two forms. I think this is more easily understood by users, specifically “older” ones (which Slate has more of than “young” ones).</p>
