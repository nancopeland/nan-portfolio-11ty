## Brief history

Over the past year, I've been working on the Slate paywall. One of the parts of the paywall I spent the most time on was testing the checkout process because I knew it was crucial to the paywall being successful.

Before mocking, I checked out a few other sites. All sites started with an "offer" landing page and then I was asked for my account and payment information. Some sites had the account and payment forms on the same page as the "offer" and some sites took you to a different page. I mocked up these two flows for Slate but wasn't sure which one would make for a better user experience so I decided to do a few rounds of user testing.

## User testing

### 1. [1-page](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392870677_1_page_-_1) vs. [3-page](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392875148_3_page_-_1) experience

For the first test, I tested a 1-page checkout experience vs. a 3-page checkout experience. I screened for users that read media sites at least once per week. 

<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="checkout experience that stays on 1 page" src="/img/checkout/UT1_1page.gif">
		<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392870677_1_page_-_1">1-page checkout</a></span>
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="checkout experience that is broken up into 3 pages" src="/img/checkout/UT1_3page.gif">
		<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/392875148_3_page_-_1">3-page checkout</a></span>
	</div>
</div>

**Result:** Overall, users understood both processes. When I asked which experience users preferred (something I am trying to not do anymore because I don't think an experience should be dictated by preference), they preferred the 1-page experience so I decided to go with that. 


### 2. [Forgot password experience](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/397971678_1-Page_Steps_-_LP)

For the next test, I wanted to test switching from the account creation form to the log in form. Slate has a lot of active commenters with accounts so I thought this might be a future use-case they'd have to deal with. 

One issue I had with this round of testing was that Invision doesn't allow [smooth scrolling](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp) transitions, which is what I had envisioned for the 1-page experience, so I couldn't mimic a coded experience as well as I had hoped.

<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="log in form with forgot password link" src="/img/checkout/UT2_login_form.png">
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="forgot password form" src="/img/checkout/UT2_forgot_password.png">
	</div>
	<span class="caption"><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/W5US9YA4QNY#/screens/397971678_1-Page_Steps_-_LP">Forgot password experience</a></span>
</div>

**Result:** I asked users to subscribe as if they already had an account but couldn't remember their password. While 2 of the 8 users couldn't find the "forgot password" link, **the users who went through the whole “forgot password” flow thought it was straightforward.**


### 3. [Coded 1-page experience](https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/1-page.html)

Because of the limitations with Invision and smooth scrolling, I wanted to test a coded version of the 1-page experience, just to make sure. Again, I asked users to assume they already had an account so they had to switch from the account creation to login form.

For this test, I broke up users into "young" (25-45) and "old" (45-65). According to the data team, "[Slate's] median age range is 35 to 44, and 50% of Slate.com readers are between ages 35 and 54" so I wanted to see if age affected the the outcome of the test.

<span class="caption"><a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/1-page.html">Coded 1-page experience</a></span>

**Result:** 8 users (of 10 total), specifically older users, had difficulty with this task. Some users didn’t log in before payment (you could see the payment form grey-ed out) while some users had trouble finding the “log in” link because both the account and payment forms were on the same page. 

Because of this, I wondered if I could **test this same flow and set of users with a coded 3-page experience and see if I got the same results.** Accounts are always difficult so I thought isolating each step might help.


### 4. [Coded 3-page experience](https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/3-page_plans.html)

For this test, I used the same screening questions and test questions as the previous test but the steps were broken up into 3 pages (like I tested in the initial test).

<span class="caption"><a href="https://slategroup.github.io/slate-prototypes/3-page_plans.html">Coded 3-page experience</a></span>

**Result:** 4 users (of 10 total) had difficulty with this task. From this, I assumed the **3-page experience was easier to understand for users trying to go from the “create account” form to the “log in” form.**


## Decision

Based on the user feedback, I decided to go with the 3-page checkout process with very clear links to “log in” and “create account” to toggle between the two forms. From the initial test, I remembered users understood both flows so when I considered what the data team said about Slate's age range, I thought the 3-page experience was a better fit. 

After many more rounds of wireframing and mocking, the checkout process ended up here:
