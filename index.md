<p class="intro"><strong>Hi, I'm Nan and I'm a product designer at <a href="https://corp.voxmedia.com/">Vox Media</a> in NYC. I enjoy talking to users, working with developers and designing in the browser.</strong></p>

<p>I worked at <a href="https://slate.com/">Slate Magazine</a> from May 2018 to May 2021. I worked with developers and product managers to add new features to Slate.com and improve the experience for our readers.</p>

<p>Before Slate, I was a front-end designer at <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a media startup in Washington, D.C. I started as a graphic designer but slowly started contributing HTML and CSS to the site which turned into a title change to "front-end designer."</p>

<p>While working at Industry Dive, I took a user experience design class at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. I had learned about how design was implemented with code but wanted to learn more about what I should do before starting the design process.</p>
