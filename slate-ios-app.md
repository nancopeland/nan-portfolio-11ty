## History


## User testing

I did the user testing in two groups: account management and podcast pages. I wanted the experience to be consistent for both locations so I needed to figure out what worked best for both. 

### Account management
 

### Podcast pages




## Decision




Thank you to product manager [Chris Schieffer](https://twitter.com/cschieffer) who reviewed the many rounds of testing.
