## History

The overall goals of the project: 

1. Improve the Slate Plus experience: landing page and letting a user know they are logged in as a Slate Plus member.
2. Improve podcast experience: are we presenting metadata in the best way, what updates should we be making so the app is update to date with [podcasts on the website](/slate-podcasts)
3. Review app navigation and menu: are we surfacing the most important sections of the app in the easiest way we can? 
4. Update style/brand of app to fit with [redesign](https://slate.com/briefing/2018/01/jason-santa-maria-on-how-slate-redesigned-the-way-we-work.html)


## Research

I started off the project by sitting down with some users to figure out how they use the app and what they would like to see in a redesign. I knew I wanted to talk to users in person (vs. using [UserTesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)) and I thought I could talk to both frequent users of the app and new users. 

I talked to 5 frequent users and 5 new users and I wrote slightly different sets of questions for each (frequent users were asked about how they use use the app each day, new users were not). Both sets of questions asked users to go thru specific parts of the app: app home, navigation/menu, podcasts and Slate Plus. 

<div class="mobile-img">

	<span class="caption">Old app experience</span> 
</div>
<div class="img-flex-wrapper">
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="Slate Plus landing page in iOS app" src="/img/slate_ios_app/s+_screen.png">
		<span class="caption">Slate Plus landing page in iOS app</span>
	</div>
	<div class="img-flex-50">
		<img alt="Latest podcast episodes in iOS app" src="/img/slate_ios_app/podcasts.png">
		<span class="caption">Latest podcast episodes in iOS app</span>
	</div>
</div>


From this, I learned that Slate iOS users opened the app because they want to read the latest Slate news (some users also open it to read the most popular or their "saved" stories) and they want to be able to navigate to said news easily. But, users had difficulty understanding and signing up for Slate Plus as well navigating to and accessing podcasts.
