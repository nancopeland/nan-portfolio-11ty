## History

When [The Verge was redesigned](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/13/23349876/the-verge-website-redesign-new-newsfeed-blogs-logo), story streams already existed as a product on Chorus, Vox Media's CMS. When streams were designed many years ago for all Vox brands (Vox, The Verge, Polygon, Eater and SB Nation), they were supposed to be a "live stream" that covered one event in a timely manner. While this was the initial idea, over the years editors started using streams as another hub/recirc page for one topic because the stream template looked a bit more interesting than a [regular hub page](https://www.vox.com/technology).

For the redesign, we moved The Verge to a new front-end system called Duet so each brand can run on the same platform (Chorus) but have a different user experience and design. For the initial streams page redesign, we decided to just skin what existed on the site pre-Duet so we could dig into the full experience later. 

When we were ready to invest time into the stream redesign, we talked to the The Verge editorial team to figure out how to optimize the stream experience. We wanted to go back to the original idea of covering one event in a timely matter with a focus on encouraging readers to stay on the stream page to get the latest event news.

**New features:** 

- Add quickposts to streams
- Live vs. not live state
- "Live updates" button
- Option to have a "highlights" section at the top with the most important stream entries
- Option to pin a stream entry to the top of the stream
- Add article preview to article links in the stream

**Other changes:** 

- Have the actual stream higher on the page
- Generally make the page seem alive instead of static
