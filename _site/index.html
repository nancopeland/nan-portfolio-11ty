		<h2>Podcast experience redesign</h2>
		<p>I updated the Slate podcasts process to make it easier for users to explore Slate’s shows, find what they’re looking for and subscribe.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Before Slate, she was a front-end designer at <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a media startup in Washington, D.C.</p>

		<h2>Flex grid menu</h2>
		<p>I re-coded the menu for all Industry Dive products using a flex grid. This resulted in a more accessible menu with code that scales better for growth.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="card">
		<h2>Library page redesign</h2>
		<p>I redesigned the Library page for each of Industry Dive’s publications with the help of the dev team to better showcase the Dive Brand Studio’s content.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>She also took a user experience design class at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>.</p>

		<h2>GIG iOS app</h2>
		<p>GIG is an app for going to concerts with your friends. It was created because I thought there was a void in the market for a service that allows you to plan, buy and attend concerts with your friends easily.</p>
